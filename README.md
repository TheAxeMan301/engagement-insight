Engagement insight demo

## Running
A python 3 script that reports the top 100 words in the dataset comments. The dataset is not included in the repository and should be engagements.csv.

## Example
`python insights.py`

## Output
The output starts with the top 100 words in all posts.

Then it goes through each post in order of most commented posts. The number of comments and top 100 words or emojis are displayed. 

## Extending
* Organizing words into positive or negative to get an overall vibe on the results
* Looking at the timestamp to measure engagement
* Looking at hashtags referenced in posts.
